My fork of SDWebImage
=========

Check out the original repo for more information on how to install this.
Also thanks to @nicholjs for his implementation.
This is basically a rewrite using UIProgressView.

Purpose
----------
This repo is done to implement a progressbar directly in the SDWebImage component.
